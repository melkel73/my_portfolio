## Description

This Website displays the work of Melanie Weyer, photographer, web developer, and all-around chica extraordinaire! 


## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![My webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-06%20at%203.58.24%20PM.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## What I did:

3/6 - Initial Deployment of the site
